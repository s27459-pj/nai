On Player 1's turn:
- Player 1 placed their `[w]` token in column 6, which fell down to the bottom of the board
- Nothing else happened because there were no tokens to capture or score

On Player 2's turn:
- Player 2 placed their `[b]` token in column 6, which fell down to the 2nd row
- The token connected with two other `[b]` tokens (underlined in green)
- These three tokens were counted towards Player 2's score and removed from the board
- Other tokens above fell down to fill the gap
